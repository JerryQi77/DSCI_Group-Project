    "\n",
    "In basketball, there is a statistic called the “plus-minus” (short-handed to “+/-”) that refers to the sum of all of the points scored while they were on the court, minus the sum of all the points they let the opposing team score. This statistic is a good quantifiable value for the overall effect of a line in a basketball game, and it can be used to determine the best line for a team to play in a game. In our project, our group is trying to approximate the plus-minus of a certain line in a basketball game using the general statistics of a line during a game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset contains the statistics of various NBA lineups. In every row of our dataset, there are the team names, players in a certain lineup, and all recorded statistics during the game such as the points scored, three-point shots made, minutes played, etc."
